# Stev232sCodeQuiz

## Description

In this project I am creating a quiz generator with a scoreboard. This project will be utilizing Event handlers to identify when an answer is selected. This project will also utilize a timer that will be used to identify the user score and tell when the user runs out of time.

## Acceptance Criteria

*WHEN I click the start button*<br>
__THEN__ a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
*WHEN I answer a question*<br>
__THEN__ I am presented with another question<br>
*WHEN I answer a question incorrectly*<br>
__THEN__ time is subtracted from the clock<br>
*WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0*<br>
__THEN__ the game is over<br>
*WHEN the game is over*<br>
__THEN__ I can save my initials and score<br>
